PyroMan
============

We are three students from Aalborg University Copenhagen (2014) taking a bachelor in Medialogy. This project has been started as a course related game development project as 4th semester students in "Object Oriented Software Engineering". The main development of this game is stretching over a period of two months starting from scratch. The game is being developed using the 3D game engine Unity3D.

## Motivation ##
The idea behind PyroMan is based on the original game of "Bomberman" developed by Hudson Soft (1983) ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(video_game))). Where you are this little guy running around a small level placing bombs trying to blow up the other player(s).

For more information about the contents of this project and the ideas behind the game see the [wiki](https://github.com/Martichoras/OOSE_Project/wiki).

## Installation and Testing ##
To contribute to the development you can fork and work on this repository, but you must first have Unity3D version 4.3.4 or higher installed [see link](http://unity3d.com/unity/download).

If you just want to try out our game or test it for bugs,
go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Martichoras/OOSE_Project/releases) and download the latest version of the game.

### Controls ###
When starting the game you'll be presented with a title menu. Here and in all other **menus**, the controls are:

* WASD or arrow keys to navigate
* Enter/Return to choose

When starting the game there are currently two players.

**Player 1** uses:

* WASD to navigate
* LCTRL (Left Control) to place a bomb

**Player 2** uses:

* Arrow keys to navigate
* RCTRL (Right Control) to place a bomb

### Power-ups ###
Power-ups will drop at random when you blow up a crate. These will all help you become stronger to beat your opponent. Here is the list of power-ups you can collect:

* Extra bomb: you can place an extra bomb before having to wait for them to blow up
* Increased exploding range: the bombs will hit objects further away
* Increased speed: you can move around faster (at some point this might be more of a power-down)

Be careful when you place your bombs though, you might risk destroying some valuable power-ups if you don't collect them first.
